            <h2 class="screen_names">NPV</h2>
            <p>Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. NPV is used in capital budgeting and investment planning to analyze the profitability of a projected investment or project.</p>
            <h3 class="screen_names2">Positive NPV</h3>
            <p>A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings generated by a project or investment—in present dollars—exceeds the anticipated costs, also in present dollars. It is assumed that an investment with a positive NPV will be profitable.</p>
            <h3 class="screen_names2">Negative NPV</h3>
            <p>An investment with a negative NPV will result in a net loss. This concept is the basis for the Net Present Value Rule, which dictates that only investments with positive NPV values should be considered.</p>

            <h1 class="screen_heading">Calculation of NPV</h1>
            <p>The steps involved in calculation of NPV are the following:</p>
            <li><b>Step 1</b> Determine the Net cash flows for each period of the life of the project. This step involves estimating both cash inflows and cash outflows. Net cashflow is simply cash inflows less cash outflows.</li>
            <li><b>Step 2</b> Determine the cost of the project. The cost of the project might be a single contracted amount or the sume of many individual expenditures. A clear distinction should be made between cost expenditures made in period zero and expenditures that reperesent operating expenses during the life of the project.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3</b> Compute the present value of the project using the net cash flows as the future amounts. The discount rate is the desired minimum rate of retrun as determind by management.</li>
            <li><b>Step 4</b> Determine whether the project cost in acceptable. If the net present value is positive, then this means the rate of return of the project is greater than the discount rate. If the net present value in negative, then the rate of return of the project is less than the discount rate</li>

            <p>
                When using present value methods, the net cash flows of the project is regarded as a series of future amounts. Because they are future amounts, the process of discounting these amounts is logical. The cost of the project is an outlay in period zero and, therefore, does not require any discounting, After the individual future net cash flows have been discounted and the sum of these amounts found, the comparison of the sum of the discounted amounts to the cost of the project is appropriate.
